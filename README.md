# Noughts-and-Crosses
## Description
A two player Noughts and Crosses game which displays score.

## How to use
Click on a vacant cell within the grid.

The first person to click will be assigned 'O' as their shape.

If you match three of the shapes horizontally, vertically or diagonally within the grid first you win, if your opponent matches three of their shapes first then they win.

## What I've learnt
This project helped me give a better understanding of event listeners within Javascript.

I also learnt better DOM manipulation and how to use arrays to collect information within the DOM and change the said array to reflect updated information.
